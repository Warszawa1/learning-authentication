üîê Authentication and Security

In this project, I explored various levels of authentication and security measures, building up to OAuth. Here are the key concepts covered:

1.**Basic Authentication (Email and Password)
    The simplest form of authentication.
    Implementation details: storing passwords securely.

2.**Encryption and Hashing
    Understanding the differences between encryption and hashing.
    Implementation of secure password hashing algorithms.

3.**Salting Passwords
    Adding salt to passwords for improved encryption.
    Preventing rainbow table attacks.

4.**Cookies and Sessions Management
    Using cookies to store session information securely.
    Best practices for session management.

5.**Environment Variables
    Securely managing sensitive information using environment variables.
    Avoiding hardcoding secrets in the source code.

6.**Google OAuth Credentials Setup
    Setting up Google OAuth credentials for authentication.
    Configuring the OAuth consent screen.

7.**Implementing "Sign In with Google"
    Integrating Google Sign-In into the application.
    Handling OAuth tokens and user sessions.
